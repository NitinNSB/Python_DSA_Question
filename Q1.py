Question : Allen's Value

You are given an array A of 'n' (n â‰¥ 3) distinct integers. Your friend Allen removes 
only 2 elements from this array, adds a value (x > 0) to all the remaining elements, 
shuffles the array, and leaves the newly formed array G for you.

Your task is to return the minimum possible value that Allen had added to each element 
of array A to get to array G.
Note:

    It is guaranteed that at least one such value which will be greater than 0 will always exist.
    Consider 1-based indexing.

Input Specification:

    input1: An integer value 'n', representing the size of array A.
    input2: An integer array A.
    input3: An integer array G created by Allen.

Output Specification:

    Return the minimum possible value that Allen had added to each element of array A to form array G.
